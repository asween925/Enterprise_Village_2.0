# Enterprise Village 2.0

This project started out to replace the previous system, FileMaker Pro 18. The system is still currently in use, at time of writing this, but is outdated and not flexible with its use. We decided that a brand-new system we could build from the ground up would be a better way of future-proofing the EV system. A system that we could continually improve and update whenever we need to. In 2021, Jak Dawson, a technology technician here at Stavros, started to create the beginning of the system. Using a combination of HTML, ASP.NET, Visual Basic, CSS, and JavaScript, he was able to make a very basic version of EV 2.0. In early 2022, Austin Sweeney was hired in place of Jak Dawson as Jak got a job at the admin building. From there, Austin and Jak worked together to create an Alpha version of EV 2.0 that had basic functionality with all its pages and systems. After that Alpha version was presented in April 2022, Austin continued to work on EV 2.0 until its official launch in October 2022. From there, we have continued to tweak and improve 2.0 and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

## Description

Enterprise Village 2.0, or EV 2.0, is the website / system that we use at the Stavros Institute to run and monitor the activities and database of Enterprise Village. We use EV 2.0 for scheduling visits with schools, entering students into the database, running each students’ jobs, students depositing money into the system, and much more. 

It is a web-based application which means it runs off a web browser like Microsoft Edge. Entering in the link to the website when connected to an approved PCSB network will gain access to the site. The site can be accessed from either tablet or computer, baring that it is approved for use by PCSB. This means that your personal phone or laptop, for example, cannot get access to EV 2.0. This is to prevent hackers or other malicious entities from abusing the site’s security. EV 2.0 can be accessed by anyone regardless of PCSB WiFi connection, this is so our out-of-district schools can enter their students’ information.

The system is used by both PCSB staff and students, with different web pages linking to a specific function within EV 2.0. For example, the Financial Officer of a business in EV will be using the Check Writing System within EV 2.0 to create and print out checks for the other students in the business. Meanwhile, a staff member could be accessing another student’s deposit information from a different computer in EV, using a different web page. EV 2.0 can be used by multiple people all at the same time using our server (A6351SEV).
Originally, it started development back in late 2021 headed up by the previous Technician (Jak) and was taken over by me (Austin) in early 2022 and officially launched on October 2022. It was created as a way to not use a program called FileMaker Pro 18 because the license of the program was going away and the district did not want to pay for it (supposedly). With EV 2.0 being entirely web based and on our own campus, we have total control over what we can do with it and we no longer have to rely on the restrictions of using a third-party application. However, EV 2.0 is very complex and involves programming, which nobody here except for the technology technician knows how to do. Thus, I've tried to take as many notes as I could during my time creating the site for not only myself, but the future technology technician to better understand how the site works.
 
2.0 is used by our staff, visiting students, and PCSB teachers that are scheduled to visit EV. Our staff uses it to create visits, edit those visits, edit student's sales and business profits, edit and add students to a visit date, and much more. Students use it in their assigned businesses for writing the payroll checks, selling an item, buying an item, depositing their checks, and creating badges in TD SYNNEX. PCSB outside teachers use it for entering in their students into our system directly, by logging in when they have a visit date.
